## ATM Simulator System 
A robust Java-based console application that simulates real-world ATM functionalities. This project demonstrates core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, including encapsulation, inheritance, and abstraction, to manage user accounts and secure financial transactions.

## 📚 Credits & Enhancements
This project was initially inspired by the [ATM System Project Tutorial](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_6klLfS1WqG8mRCW5a-bIViq1DbzQkp9&si=AicgGCBJwTylv6px). 

However, I have significantly **enhanced and customized** the original logic to improve the user experience and code structure. My unique contributions include:
* Reduced number of classes to make code efficient.
* Added validations on data input fields. 
* Overall easy to debug file system.
